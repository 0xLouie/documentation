# Why Social Prediction?

Prediction markets are powerful. But they're broken in one fundamental way: **they're structurally anti-social.**

---

## The Problem Today

Today's prediction markets are designed like trading platforms—anonymous, transactional, and financial. Users place bets in silence, with:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="No Identity" icon="user-slash">
    Anonymous wallets and usernames. No profiles, no reputation, no face.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Social Feedback" icon="comment-slash">
    No friends, no rivalries, no shared experiences. Just you against the market.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Progression" icon="chart-line">
    No levels, no achievements, no seasons. Nothing to work toward beyond money.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Reason to Return" icon="door-open">
    Without community, even the largest platforms struggle with long-term retention.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  As a result, users don't feel part of anything. They trade. They leave. They don't come back.

## The Opportunity

Prediction behavior already exists everywhere in culture:

| Where Predictions Happen | Current Experience |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Group chats | "I bet you $20 Lakers win" |
| Sports communities | Fantasy leagues, pick'ems |
| Social timelines | Hot takes and arguments |
| Creator ecosystems | Audience polls and debates |
| Political discussions | Election predictions |

**The behavior is natural. The infrastructure doesn't exist.**

## Why Now?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mainstream Awareness" icon="chart-line">
    Prediction markets broke into mainstream consciousness in 2024-2025, driven by elections, sports, and crypto adoption. Over **$27.9B in volume** processed January-October 2025.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Proven Demand" icon="check">
    Kalshi raised $1B at an $11B valuation. Polymarket became a cultural phenomenon. Both succeeded **without a social product**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Perfect Timing" icon="clock">
    Demand is real. Category awareness is rising. The social layer hasn't been built yet. **Until now.**

## The Shift

| Traditional Markets | Versus |
|--------------------|--------|
| Financial motivation | Social motivation |
| Anonymous trading | Identity-based competition |
| Isolated wagering | Interactive challenges |
| Speculation-driven | Culture and competition-driven |
| Transaction → exit | Retention → loyalty → habit |

<Note>
  Versus shifts prediction from financial to social—creating retention, loyalty, and ongoing participation driven not by market volatility, but by **culture and competition**.
