## The Missing Piece: Fun

Traditional prediction markets are powerful but sterile. They feel like trading platforms, not entertainment.

**Versus fills the gap:**

| Traditional Markets | Versus |
|---------------------|--------|
| Anonymous, isolated | Social, connected |
| Complex interfaces | Mobile-first design |
| Serious finance vibes | Game-like experience |
| No community | Friends, leagues, rivalries |
| Static and boring | Live feeds, challenges, leaderboards |

    Real-time updates, live feeds, and dynamic odds keep you in the action.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fair">
    Transparent mechanics, clear rules, and a level playing field for all.
