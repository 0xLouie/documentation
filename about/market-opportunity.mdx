Prediction markets are breaking into mainstream awareness. But the biggest opportunity isn't in finance. It's in culture.

---

## Why Now

Prediction markets are breaking into mainstream awareness driven by global events, elections, sports, creator culture, and crypto adoption.

Across January-October 2025, the category processed over **$27.9B in volume**, with exponential social visibility.

Kalshi and Polymarket have proven institutional and mainstream demand, yet both succeeded without a social product.

**The timing is perfect:** demand is real, category awareness is rising, and the social layer hasn't been built yet.

    Kalshi's recent $1B raise demonstrates institutional confidence
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Kalshi's raise demonstrates institutional confidence and regulatory momentum. Polymarket's cultural breakout proves consumer appetite.

Both reached scale while being almost entirely non-social.

**Which leads to an obvious question:** What happens when prediction and social behavior converge?

Versus is the answer.

## TAM Expansion

Today's prediction markets target the financially motivated, not the socially motivated.

Yet most prediction behavior in real life happens in:

- Group chats
- Fandoms
- Sports communities
- Social timelines
- Creator ecosystems

More than financial platforms.

<Note>
Versus expands TAM by moving prediction from niche finance into mass culture. Similar to how DraftKings turned sports betting into entertainment instead of finance.

## Target Users

Our users aren't speculators. They're competitive social participants:

| User Type | Motivation |
|-----------|------------|
| **Sports fans** | Debating outcomes with friends |
| **Politically engaged communities** | Putting conviction behind analysis |
| **Creator audiences** | Participating in prediction rooms |
| **Esports-native Gen Z** | Already comfortable with rankings and seasons |
| **Friend groups** | Competing to be right |

Prediction is already part of culture. Versus gives it structure, identity, and reward.

## Competitive Landscape

| Platform | Strength | Weakness | Versus Advantage |
|----------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **Kalshi** | Regulatory, institutional | No social features | Social layer |
| **Polymarket** | Cultural awareness | Anonymous, transactional | Identity & competition |
| **Fantasy Sports** | Massive user base | Single sport, seasonal | Cross-category, always-on |
