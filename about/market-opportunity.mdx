# Market Opportunity

Prediction markets are having their moment. But the biggest opportunity isn't in finance—it's in **culture**.

## The Numbers

    Volume processed January-October 2025
  </Card>
  <Card title="$11B" icon="building">
    Kalshi valuation (2024 funding round)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Kalshi and Polymarket proved institutional and mainstream demand—**without a social product**. The social layer hasn't been built yet.
</Note>

## TAM Expansion

Today's prediction markets target the **financially motivated**. But most prediction behavior happens among the **socially motivated**:

| Where Predictions Actually Happen | Current Infrastructure |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Group chats | None |
| Fandoms | None |
| Sports communities | Fantasy (limited) |
| Social timelines | Polls (no stakes) |
| Creator ecosystems | None |

<Note>
  Versus expands TAM by moving prediction from niche finance into mass culture—similar to how DraftKings turned sports betting into entertainment.
