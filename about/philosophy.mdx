# The Versus Philosophy

We're not building another prediction market. We're building a new product category: Competitive Social Prediction.

---

## Core Belief

<Note>
  **Prediction is already social.** We're giving it structure, identity, and reward.
</Note>

Instead of forecasting against a faceless market, users challenge real people. Friends, creators, communities, rivals. Opinions and outcomes become shared gameplay.

---

## The Transformation

Similar to how:
- **Twitch** made gaming social
- **Robinhood** socialized trading
- **DraftKings** turned sports betting into entertainment

**Versus socializes prediction.** Opening it to millions who currently watch from the sidelines.

## What We Build Around

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Identity → Retention" icon="user">
    When you have a profile, reputation, and history, you have something to protect. You come back.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Competition → Habit" icon="trophy">
    When you're competing against people you know, every outcome matters. Prediction becomes daily.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Achievement → Loyalty" icon="star">
    XP, badges, seasons, and ranks give you reasons to stay engaged beyond any single prediction.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Social Graph → Network Effects" icon="diagram-project">
    Every friend makes the platform more valuable. Users bring users.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Design Principles

<Steps>
  <Step title="Social First, Always">
    Every feature asks: "How does this create connection?" If it doesn't, we reconsider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Competition Over Speculation">
    We optimize for engagement and rivalry, not trading volume. The goal is fun, not finance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Progression Matters">
    Users should feel like they're building something. Rank, reputation, achievements. Not just gambling.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accessible to Everyone">
    You don't need to understand odds. If you can have an opinion, you can play.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</AccordionGroup>

## The End Goal

People return to Versus not because markets move, but because **people do**.

| Why Users Leave Other Platforms | Why Users Stay on Versus |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Won money, cashed out | Climbing the leaderboard |
| Lost money, gave up | Revenge match with a friend |
| Got bored alone | Group challenge tonight |
| No reason to check back | Season rewards unlocking |

---

## The Future We See

Prediction becomes:
- **Infrastructure** embedded in social platforms, newsletters, streams
- **Creator-driven** with influencer prediction rooms and tournaments
- **Always-on** via mobile with live outcomes and push notifications
- **Cultural** not financial. A thing people do together.
