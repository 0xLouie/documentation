# The Versus Philosophy

We're not just building a prediction market. We're creating a new category of social entertainment.

---

## Our Core Beliefs

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Predictions Are Social" icon="comments">
    The best debates happen between friends. Versus lets you put your conviction where your mouth is.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Competition Drives Engagement" icon="fire">
    Leaderboards, challenges, and bragging rights make every prediction meaningful.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transparency Builds Trust" icon="eye">
    Open odds, visible mechanics, and fair play aren't features—they're foundations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mobile-First, Always" icon="mobile">
    Your predictions should be as accessible as checking social media.
  </Card>

## The Problem We Saw

Traditional prediction markets suffer from three fatal flaws:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="They're isolating" icon="user">
    Trading in a vacuum against anonymous counterparties feels cold and transactional. There's no community, no rivalry, no story.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="They're intimidating" icon="chart-line">
    Complex interfaces, financial jargon, and overwhelming data screens scare away casual users who might have great insights.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="They're forgettable" icon="moon">
    Without social hooks, notifications, and engagement loops, users drift away. The markets become ghost towns.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Our Solution

- **Live Feed**: See real-time activity from your network
- **Leaderboards**: Global, category-specific, and friend-only rankings
- **Profiles**: Build a reputation that follows you across markets

## Design Principles

We follow these principles in every decision:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Default to Simple">
    If a feature needs extensive explanation, it's probably too complex. Strip it down.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make It Personal">
    Anonymous activity is forgettable. Named activity creates stories and stakes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Celebrate Everything">
    Wins, streaks, milestones—give users reasons to feel good and come back.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trust Your Users">
    Don't hide information or add friction "for their protection." Informed users make better predictions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Success Looks Like

<Note>
  We measure success not by volume traded, but by moments created.
</Note>

- Friends debating their positions over dinner
- Group chats buzzing when markets move
- Social media posts celebrating (or lamenting) outcomes
- Return users who check Versus as part of their daily routine

Versus is just the beginning. Our vision extends to:

| Phase | Focus |
