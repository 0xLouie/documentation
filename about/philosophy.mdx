# The Versus Philosophy

We're not building another prediction market. We're building a new product category: Competitive Social Prediction.

---

## Core Belief

Prediction is already social. We're giving it structure, identity, and reward.

Instead of forecasting against a faceless market, users challenge real people. Friends, creators, communities, rivals. Opinions and outcomes become shared gameplay.

---

## The Transformation

Similar to how:
- **Twitch** made gaming social
- **Robinhood** socialized trading
- **DraftKings** turned sports betting into entertainment

**Versus socializes prediction.** Opening it to millions who currently watch from the sidelines.

---

## Why We Win

Social experience is the missing piece.

| Element | Result |
|---------|--------|
| **Identity** | Retention |
| **Competition** | Habit |
| **Achievement** | Loyalty |
| **Social graph** | Network effects |

Prediction today is a tool. Versus turns it into a community, culture, and ongoing activity people want to return to. Not because markets move, but because people do.

## Product & UX (How It Works)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a real-world outcome">
    Pick any market: sports, politics, crypto, culture
  </Step>
  <Step title="Challenge a friend or accept a 1v1">
    Select an opponent from your network
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stake confidence">
    Both sides commit tokens
  </Step>
  <Step title="Result resolves automatically">
    When the event concludes, winner is determined
  </Step>
  <Step title="Winner climbs rankings and unlocks new status">
    XP, badges, leaderboard position
  </Step>
</Steps>

Persistent identity (profiles), progression (XP), and seasonal competition give users a reason to return, compete, and improve. Similar to the most successful gaming and social apps.

## Who We're For

Our users aren't speculators. They're competitive social participants:

| User Type | What They Do |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Sports fans** | Debating outcomes with friends |
| **Politically engaged communities** | Putting conviction behind analysis |
| **Creator audiences** | Participating in prediction rooms and tournaments |
| **Esports-native Gen Z** | Already comfortable with rankings and seasons |
| **Friend groups** | Competing to be right |

Prediction is already part of culture. Versus gives it structure, identity, and reward. Making participation visible and meaningful, instead of disposable.

---

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js + React + TypeScript for a performant, scalable, and maintainable experience |
| **Authentication** | Privy for secure, user-friendly onchain authentication and wallet identity |
| **Database** | MongoDB for storing user profiles, positions, leaderboards, and market history |
| **Backend** | Render for backend services powering market logic, authentication flows, and real-time updates |
| **Markets** | Kalshi API to execute compliant, regulated trades behind the scenes while Versus delivers a social, gamified UX |
