# Ranking Algorithm

Versus uses a sophisticated ranking system to create fair, competitive leaderboards. Here's how it works.

---

## Ranking Philosophy

<Note>
  The best predictors should rise to the top, regardless of volume or risk tolerance.
</Note>

Our ranking balances:
- **Accuracy**: Getting predictions right
- **Consistency**: Performing well over time
- **Volume**: Participating actively
- **Risk Management**: Smart position sizing

---

## Primary Ranking Score

The Versus Score (VS) is calculated as:

```
VS = (Win Rate × Volume Factor × Consistency Bonus) - Risk Penalty
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Win Rate">
    **Base Performance**
    
    Your win rate is weighted by the odds of your entries:
    
    ```
    Weighted Win Rate = Σ(Wins × Inverse Odds) / Σ(All Predictions × Inverse Odds)
    ```
    
    | Prediction Type | Win Rate Impact |
    |-----------------|-----------------|
    | Win at 20% odds | High (beat expectations) |
    | Win at 80% odds | Low (met expectations) |
    | Loss at 80% odds | High penalty |
    | Loss at 20% odds | Low penalty |
    
    <Info>
      Beating long odds rewards more than confirming favorites.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Volume Factor">
    **Activity Multiplier**
    
    More predictions = higher confidence in your ranking:
    
    | Predictions | Factor |
    |-------------|--------|
    | 1-10 | 0.5x |
    | 11-50 | 0.75x |
    | 51-100 | 1.0x |
    | 101-250 | 1.1x |
    | 250+ | 1.2x |
    
    <Warning>
      Volume helps but can't overcome a poor win rate. Quality over quantity.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Consistency">
    **Streak Bonus**
    
    Consistent performance earns bonuses:
    
    | Streak Type | Bonus |
    |-------------|-------|
    | 5+ win streak | +5% |
    | 10+ win streak | +10% |
    | 7-day positive | +3% |
    | 30-day positive | +8% |
    | Category expertise | +5% per category |
    
    <Tip>
      Steady performers outrank hot-cold bettors over time.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Risk Penalty">
    **Sustainability Check**
    
    Reckless betting is penalized:
    
    | Behavior | Penalty |
    |----------|---------|
    | Max bet > 50% of bankroll | -5% |
    | 3+ losses in a row | -2% |
    | Single-category concentration | -3% |
    | Chasing losses pattern | -10% |
    
    <Info>
      Smart risk management is rewarded in rankings.

## Leaderboard Types

Different leaderboards use different weightings:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Global Leaderboard" icon="globe">
    **All-Time Best**
    
    - Heaviest weight on total PnL
    - Minimum 50 predictions required
    - Volume factor capped at 1.2x
    - All categories included
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Category Leaderboards" icon="folder">
    **Topic Experts**
    
    - Only predictions in specific category count
    - Win rate weighted more heavily
    - Minimum 10 category predictions
    - Badges for top 10 in each category
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Friends Leaderboard" icon="user-group">
    **Inner Circle**
    
    - Same algorithm, smaller pool
    - Real-time updates
    - Weekly resets available
    - Challenge record as tiebreaker
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Seasonal Leaderboard" icon="trophy">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Time Decay

Recent performance matters more:

| Prediction Age | Weight |
|----------------|--------|
| Last 7 days | 100% |
| 8-30 days | 80% |
| 31-90 days | 60% |
| 91-180 days | 40% |
| 180+ days | 20% |

<Note>
  This ensures active users can climb and inactive users naturally fall, while preserving historical accomplishments.
</Note>
