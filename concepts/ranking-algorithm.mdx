Versus isn't just about winning predictions. It's about building a track record. Our ranking and XP systems reward consistent performance and social engagement.

## XP System

Every action on Versus earns XP:

| Action | XP Earned |
|--------|-----------|
| Win a prediction | Base XP + bonus for odds beaten |
| Win a 1v1 challenge | Higher XP (social bonus) |
| Complete a streak | Streak multiplier |
| Invite a friend | Referral bonus |
| Daily login | Consistency bonus |

<Note>
  XP compounds. The more active you are, the faster you progress.
