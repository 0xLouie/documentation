# How Odds Move

Odds on Versus are dynamic. They shift based on participant predictions. Understanding these movements helps you find value and time your entries.

---

## Market Mechanics

Versus uses an **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** to determine odds:

<Note>
  More predictions on one outcome → Higher probability displayed → Lower payout for that outcome
</Note>

The AMM ensures:
- Always liquidity available
- Instant execution
- Fair, manipulation-resistant pricing

## How Predictions Affect Odds

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial State">
    A new market opens with balanced odds (often 50/50 or based on external data).
  </Step>
  <Step title="First Predictions">
    Early predictors enter positions. Each prediction shifts odds toward the selected outcome.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Price Discovery">
    As more predictors participate, odds converge toward the market's collective belief.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Information Arrives">
    News and events cause rapid odds movements as predictors react.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolution">
    Odds approach 0% or 100% as the outcome becomes clear.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Slippage Explained

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Slippage?" icon="chart-line">
    Slippage is the difference between expected price and execution price for large orders.
    
    **Example**:
    - Displayed odds: 40%
    - Your large order moves odds to 45%
    - Your average execution: ~42.5%
    
    You get a blend of prices as your order moves through the market.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Minimizing Slippage" icon="shield">
    Strategies to reduce slippage:
    
    - **Smaller positions**: Less market impact
    - **Limit orders**: Set maximum price
    - **Patient entry**: Spread over time
    - **Low-activity times**: Less competition
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Slippage Protection" icon="lock">
    Versus offers built-in protection:
    
    - Maximum slippage setting (default: 2%)
    - Order rejected if slippage exceeds threshold
    - Preview shows expected execution price
  </Accordion>

## Market Efficiency

Prediction markets become more efficient over time:

| Phase | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Early** | Wide spreads, volatile, opportunity for alpha |
| **Mid** | Narrowing spread, stabilizing, following news |
| **Late** | Tight spread, efficient, hard to beat |
| **Resolution** | Binary (approaches 0% or 100%) |

<Tip>
  Early movers often capture the most value, but take more risk. Late movers have less risk but smaller payouts.
</Tip>
