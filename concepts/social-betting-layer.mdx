The Social Betting Layer is what makes Versus different. It transforms isolated wagering into interactive social competition.

## The Core Problem We Solve

Traditional prediction markets are:

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Anonymous | No identity, no reputation |
| Transactional | No social feedback |
| Financial-only | No progression, no fun |
| Isolated | No reason to return |

**Result:** Users trade, leave, and never come back.

## The Versus Solution

We layer social mechanics on top of prediction:

  <Card title="Identity" icon="user">
    Profiles, usernames, avatars. You're a person, not a wallet.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Competition" icon="trophy">
    Leaderboards, rankings, 1v1 challenges
  </Card>
  <Card title="Progression" icon="star">
    XP, seasons, achievements, badges
  </Card>
  <Card title="Connection" icon="users">
    Friends, parties, activity feeds
  </Card>
