# Social Betting Layer

The Social Betting Layer is what makes Versus different. It's the framework that turns solitary prediction into social competition.

---

## Core Philosophy

<Note>
  Predictions are more engaging when they involve people you know.
</Note>

Traditional prediction markets are efficient but cold. The Social Betting Layer adds:

- **Identity**: Real profiles, not anonymous wallets
- **Connection**: Friend networks and communities
- **Competition**: Leaderboards and challenges
- **Narrative**: Stories and bragging rights
