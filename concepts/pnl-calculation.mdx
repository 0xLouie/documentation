# How PnL is Calculated

Understanding how profit and loss (PnL) works on Versus helps you make smarter predictions. Here's the complete breakdown.

---

## The Basics

PnL is simple at its core:

<Note>
  **Profit** = Payout - Amount Wagered (if you win)
  
  **Loss** = Amount Wagered (if you lose)
</Note>

Your return depends on the odds at the time you enter your prediction.

---

## Calculating Payouts

When you make a prediction, your potential payout is locked in:

```
Payout = Amount / (Odds / 100)
```

### Example Calculation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Example 1: 40% Odds">
    **Scenario**: You predict YES at 40% odds with 100 tokens
    
    | Input | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | Amount | 100 tokens |
    | Entry Odds | 40% |
    
    **Calculation**:
    ```
    Payout = 100 / 0.40 = 250 tokens
    ```
    
    | Outcome | Result |
    |---------|--------|
    | **If YES wins** | You receive 250 tokens (+150 profit) |
    | **If NO wins** | You receive 0 tokens (-100 loss) |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Example 2: 75% Odds">
    **Scenario**: You predict YES at 75% odds with 100 tokens
    
    | Input | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | Amount | 100 tokens |
    | Entry Odds | 75% |
    
    **Calculation**:
    ```
    Payout = 100 / 0.75 = 133.33 tokens
    ```
    
    | Outcome | Result |
    |---------|--------|
    | **If YES wins** | You receive 133.33 tokens (+33.33 profit) |
    | **If NO wins** | You receive 0 tokens (-100 loss) |
    
    <Info>
      Higher probability = lower payout, but higher chance of winning.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Example 3: 15% Odds">
    **Scenario**: You predict YES at 15% odds with 100 tokens
    
    | Input | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | Amount | 100 tokens |
    | Entry Odds | 15% |
    
    **Calculation**:
    ```
    Payout = 100 / 0.15 = 666.67 tokens
    ```
    
    | Outcome | Result |
    |---------|--------|
    | **If YES wins** | You receive 666.67 tokens (+566.67 profit) |
    | **If NO wins** | You receive 0 tokens (-100 loss) |
    
    <Info>
      Long shots pay big but win rarely. Choose wisely.
    </Info>
  </Tab>

## Return on Investment (ROI)

ROI measures efficiency:

```
ROI = (Profit / Amount) × 100%
```

| Entry Odds | Potential ROI (if correct) |
|------------|---------------------------|
| 10% | +900% |
| 25% | +300% |
| 40% | +150% |
| 50% | +100% |
| 60% | +66.7% |
| 75% | +33.3% |
| 90% | +11.1% |

## Unrealized vs Realized PnL

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Unrealized PnL" icon="clock">
    **Before Resolution**
    
    Your unrealized PnL shows what you would make *if the market resolved right now at current odds*. It's theoretical.
    
    - Fluctuates as odds move
    - Green when odds favor your position
    - Red when odds move against you
    - Changes second by second
    
    <Warning>
      Unrealized PnL is NOT your actual profit or loss. Only the final outcome determines your return.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Realized PnL" icon="flag-checkered">
    **After Resolution**
    
    Your realized PnL is your actual profit or loss once the market resolves:
    
    - Fixed and final
    - Based on your entry odds, not current odds
    - Equals payout minus amount (if won) or negative amount (if lost)
    - Updates your overall statistics
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Why Odds Don't Affect Final PnL

A common confusion: **odds moving after your entry don't change your payout**.

<Tip>
  Your payout is locked at your entry odds. Subsequent odds movement only affects new predictors, not you.
</Tip>

### Example

1. You enter YES at 40% odds (potential payout: 2.5x)
2. Odds move to 70% (new entrants get 1.43x)
3. Odds move to 30% (new entrants get 3.33x)
4. Market resolves YES

**Your payout**: 2.5x (based on your 40% entry)

## Cumulative Statistics

Your profile tracks:

| Stat | Calculation |
|------|-------------|
| **Total PnL** | Sum of all realized profits and losses |
| **Win Rate** | (Wins / Total Resolved) × 100% |
| **Avg Return** | Total PnL / Number of Predictions |
| **ROI** | Total PnL / Total Amount Predicted |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | Risk-adjusted return measure |

---

## Fees

<Note>
  Versus charges a small fee on winning predictions only. Losing predictions have no additional fee.
</Note>

| Fee Type | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Platform fee | 2% of profit (winners only) |
| Withdrawal fee | Network gas costs |

### Fee Example

- You win a prediction with 150 token profit
- Platform fee: 150 × 2% = 3 tokens
- Net profit: 147 tokens

## Tax Considerations

<Warning>
  This is not tax advice. Consult a professional for your specific situation.
</Warning>

Prediction market winnings may be taxable income in your jurisdiction. Consider:

- Keeping records of all predictions
- Tracking net gains and losses
- Exporting your prediction history for tax purposes
- Consulting with a tax professional
