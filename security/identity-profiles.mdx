# Identity Profiles

Your Versus identity is your reputation. It follows you across predictions, validates your track record, and builds trust in the community.

---

## Why Identity Matters

<Note>
  Anonymous prediction markets suffer from manipulation and lack of accountability. Versus requires identity to ensure fair play and meaningful competition.
</Note>

| Anonymous Markets | Versus Identity |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| No accountability | Persistent reputation |
| Multiple accounts easy | Sybil-resistant |
| No track record | Verified history |
| Manipulation risk | Trust and transparency |
