## Understanding Odds

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Probability Display" icon="percent">
    Odds are shown as percentages representing the market's implied probability:
    
    - **65%** = Market believes this outcome has a 65% chance
    - **35%** = Market believes this has a 35% chance
    
    Lower probability outcomes offer higher payouts if correct.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Potential Payout Calculation" icon="calculator">
    Your potential payout is calculated as:
    
    ```
    Payout = Amount / (Odds / 100)
    
    Example:
    Amount: 100 tokens
    Odds: 40%
    Payout: 100 / 0.40 = 250 tokens
    Profit: 150 tokens (150% return)
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Odds Movement" icon="chart-line">
    After your prediction:
    
    - Your entry odds are locked
    - Market odds continue to move based on new predictions
    - Your PnL is calculated against your entry, not current odds
    
    <Info>
      You profit when you're correct, regardless of how odds move after entry.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
