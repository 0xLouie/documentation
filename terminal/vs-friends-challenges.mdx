# Vs Friends Challenges

Challenges are the heart of social competition on Versus. Go head-to-head with friends on any market for ultimate bragging rights.

---

## What is a Challenge?

A challenge is a direct prediction battle between two users:

- **You pick the market**
- **You pick your side**
- **Your friend takes the opposite side**
- **Winner takes bragging rights (and stakes, if wagered)**

<Info>
  Challenges are more than just parallel predictions—they're a commitment to face off directly.
