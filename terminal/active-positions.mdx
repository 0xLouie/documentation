## PnL Indicators

Your positions use color coding:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🟢 **Green** | Currently profitable (odds moved in your favor) |
| 🔴 **Red** | Currently at a loss (odds moved against you) |
| ⚪ **White/Gray** | Neutral (odds near entry) |

<Note>
  Unrealized PnL is theoretical. Your actual return depends on the final outcome, not intermediate odds movements.
