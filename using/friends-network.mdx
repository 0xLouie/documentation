## Connection Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Friends">
    **Mutual Connections**
    
    Friends are two-way connections where both parties have accepted:
    
    - See each other's predictions in real-time
    - Challenge each other directly
    - Appear on each other's friend leaderboards
    - Full profile visibility
    
    <Info>
      Friend limit: 25 (Free) | Unlimited (Pro)
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Followers">
    **One-Way Following**
    
    Anyone can follow you (unless you disable it):
    
    - Followers see your public predictions
    - You don't see their activity unless you follow back
    - Followers can challenge you (if enabled)
    - Building followers increases your influence
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Following">
    **People You Watch**
    
    Follow interesting predictors without friending:
    
    - See their predictions in your feed
    - Track their performance over time
    - Learn from top predictors' strategies
    - No reciprocal access to your activity
  </Tab>
